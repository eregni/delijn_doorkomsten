### Description
Terminal program to show realtime info from De lijn. I wrote this thing because the official
(android) app works awfully slow on my phone. A solution is to make a terminal program with
(a lot) fewer features:

*   search realtime info for a specific bus stop. When there's no result search for
    a stop by name

*   Filter search results by line nr

### Usage:
Run: python main.py  
Run on android: use termux on android -> https://termux.com/
